  Per the docs https://netbox.readthedocs.io/en/stable/models/ipam/vlan/:
  A VLAN represents an isolated Layer 2 domain identified by a numeric ID (1–4094). VLANs may be assigned to specific sites or marked as global.
  Optionally, they can be organized within VLAN groups to define scope and enforce uniqueness.
  Each VLAN can also be assigned an operational status and a functional role. Statuses are hard-coded in NetBox and include the following:
  * Active
  * Reserved
  * Deprecated
  This resource will retrieve the next available VLAN ID from a given VLAN group (specified by ID).
